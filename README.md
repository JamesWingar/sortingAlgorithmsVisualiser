# VisualSortingAlgorithms

visualSortingAlgorithms is designed to display four major (popular) sorting algorithms to show the methodology and time complexity of each algorithm.    

visual Sorting Algorithms supports being run on any Python environment (Tested python 3.8+) with the only requirement being the pygame library if requiring the GUI.

## Install
Prerequisites
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
* [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
* [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)

To install follow the instructions below:
1. Open a command line tool (eg. Linux -> Terminal, Windows -> Powershell)
2. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Change directory to where you want the MagicMirror using the `cd` command
4. 
```python
git clone https://github.com/JamesWingar/visualSortingAlgorithms
```
5. Change directory to inside the directory `mirror_project`
6. 
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
7. You are ready to go!

(*Note: you can use a virtual environment at step 6 to install the packages*)
